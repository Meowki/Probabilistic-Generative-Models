## Introduction

This module provides a modern introduction to *probabilistic generative modelling*, from foundational conceptual principles including graphical models, variational inference and Bayesian nonparametric models, to recent developments such as Transformers, diffusion models and flow matching. The module aims to give students a unified understanding of generative modelling as the *transportation of probability distributions*. The course blends mathematical content, algorithm development, and hands-on demonstrations.
